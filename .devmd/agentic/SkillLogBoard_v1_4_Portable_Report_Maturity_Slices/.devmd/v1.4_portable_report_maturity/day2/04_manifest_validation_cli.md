# 04_manifest_validation_cli — manifest validation CLI

## Objective

Add or refine CLI validation for report manifests.

## Context

v1.4 matures static dashboard/report outputs into portable, offline-friendly research evidence packages with manifests, figures, tables, and provenance metadata.

## Dependencies

- v1.3 Commercial Live UI completed or planned separately.
- Static dashboard/report outputs remain independent from the Live Board app.
- Report Artifact Layer v0.7+ concepts are available.

## Target Files

- src/skilllogboard/cli/main.py
- src/skilllogboard/report/validate.py
- tests/test_cli_report.py

## Implementation Steps

1. Add `skilllog report validate` or extend existing validate command.
2. Validate manifest presence, asset paths, figure/table paths, and provenance fields.
3. Return machine-readable errors if existing CLI supports JSON output.
4. Add tests.

## Acceptance Criteria

- CLI validates report package.
- Missing assets are reported clearly.
- Tests pass.

## Verification Commands

```bash
pytest -q tests/test_cli_report.py tests/test_report_manifest.py
```

## Non-goals

- Do not require the Live Board server to view static reports.
- Do not require external CDN/network access for portable reports.
- Do not replace report artifacts with screenshots only.
- Do not implement TensorBoard/W&B import.
- Do not implement Prometheus/Grafana integration.
- Do not implement cloud sync.
- Do not implement multi-user auth.
- Do not add a database backend.
- Do not perform TestPyPI/PyPI publishing in this slice.
- Do not weaken local-first, inspectable-file behavior.

## Handoff Notes

- Keep the slice focused and reviewable.
- Prefer additive metadata/state fields over breaking existing artifact contracts.
- Preserve the separation between portable static evidence and local Live Board app behavior.
- If an item is deferred, document the reason in the Agent Completion Block.
- Update related docs/status/changelog when user-visible behavior changes.
