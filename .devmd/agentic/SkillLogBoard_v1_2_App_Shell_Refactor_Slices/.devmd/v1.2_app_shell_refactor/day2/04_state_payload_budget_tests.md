# 04_state_payload_budget_tests — state payload budget tests

## Objective

Add tests to prevent accidental large payloads in Overview and Runs view.

## Context

v1.2 restructures Live Board into a screen-based local app shell with project overview as the default project-watch landing page and lazy, view-scoped data loading.

## Dependencies

- v1.1.2 Showcase / Visual Parity completed.
- Current Live Board compare/artifact/agent features remain available.
- Static dashboard/report outputs remain portable and separate from Live Board.

## Target Files

- tests/test_live_project.py
- tests/test_live_server.py

## Implementation Steps

1. Create fixtures with many runs and multiple metrics.
2. Assert overview/runs payload does not include full per-step series.
3. Assert compare/lab payload includes series only when explicitly requested.
4. Add max runs/max points checks where relevant.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Payload budget tests exist.
- Overview/runs stay summary-first.
- Compare/lab remain bounded.
- Tests pass.

## Verification Commands

```bash
pytest -q tests/test_live_project.py tests/test_live_server.py
```

## Non-goals

- Do not migrate to React/Vite in v1.2 unless explicitly approved; v1.3 owns the commercial frontend stack.
- Do not implement TensorBoard/W&B import.
- Do not implement Prometheus/Grafana integration.
- Do not implement cloud sync.
- Do not implement multi-user auth.
- Do not add a database backend.
- Do not perform TestPyPI/PyPI publishing in this slice.
- Do not weaken local-first, inspectable-file behavior.

## Handoff Notes

- Keep the slice focused and reviewable.
- Prefer additive state/API fields over breaking existing contracts.
- Keep static dashboard/report portability separate from Live Board app behavior.
- If an item is deferred, document the reason in the Agent Completion Block.
- Update related docs/status/changelog when user-visible behavior changes.

**Notes:** Implemented v1.2 app shell scope with view routing, project/run default views, view-scoped state, summary-first project payloads, bounded compare/lab series, docs, tests, and v1.3 handoff. Remote CI was not checked because no push/CI run was requested.
