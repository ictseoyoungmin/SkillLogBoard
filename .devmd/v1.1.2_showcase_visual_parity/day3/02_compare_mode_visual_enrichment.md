# 02_compare_mode_visual_enrichment — compare mode visual enrichment

## Objective

Make compare mode visibly distinct and convincing.

## Context

v1.1.1 implemented true compare/overlay and core UI interaction hardening. However, the actual UI can still look less capable than the design mockups because many advanced features are hidden behind drawers, sparse demo data, and minimal affordances. v1.1.2 should improve perceived product completeness without violating local-first or lightweight-package principles.

## Dependencies

- v1.1.1 UI Polish / True Compare completed.
- Live Board core APIs remain compatible.
- Existing static dashboard/report/compare/agent/template-forge behavior remains green.

## Target Files

- src/skilllogboard/live/templates/live.html
- src/skilllogboard/live/templates/ui_tokens.css
- tests/test_live_ui_snapshot.py

## Implementation Steps

1. Add compare-mode banner or mode chip.
2. Show selected metric, selected run count, shared metric count, and bounds.
3. Refine run legend spacing and color swatches.
4. Show downsample/truncation warning if compare payload reports it.
5. Add tests for compare mode visual markers.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Compare mode looks intentional.
- Selected run count and metric are visible.
- Legend is readable.
- Tests pass.

## Verification Commands

```bash
pytest -q tests/test_live_ui_snapshot.py
```

## Non-goals

- Do not implement TensorBoard/W&B import.
- Do not implement Prometheus/Grafana integration.
- Do not implement cloud sync.
- Do not implement multi-user auth.
- Do not add a database backend.
- Do not add React/Vue/Svelte build tooling unless separately approved.
- Do not add heavy dependencies to core.
- Do not perform TestPyPI/PyPI release work in this slice.

## Handoff Notes

- This milestone is about visible product completeness, not broad backend expansion.
- Prefer better demo data, empty states, affordances, and layout polish over complex systems.
- Keep the default UI minimal, but make hidden capabilities discoverable.
- Avoid fake functionality. Showcase hints must reflect actual local state or clearly available actions.
