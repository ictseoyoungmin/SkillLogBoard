# 04_visual_parity_spacing_pass — visual parity spacing pass

## Objective

Run a final visual spacing pass based on the mockup direction.

## Context

v1.1.1 implemented true compare/overlay and core UI interaction hardening. However, the actual UI can still look less capable than the design mockups because many advanced features are hidden behind drawers, sparse demo data, and minimal affordances. v1.1.2 should improve perceived product completeness without violating local-first or lightweight-package principles.

## Dependencies

- v1.1.1 UI Polish / True Compare completed.
- Live Board core APIs remain compatible.
- Existing static dashboard/report/compare/agent/template-forge behavior remains green.

## Target Files

- src/skilllogboard/live/templates/live.html
- src/skilllogboard/live/templates/ui_tokens.css
- docs/ui_design_guidelines.md
- tests/test_live_ui_snapshot.py

## Implementation Steps

1. Review topbar, rail, overview band, chart workspace, side panel, tray, drawer spacing.
2. Reduce unnecessary border density.
3. Improve visual rhythm between navy background and surfaces.
4. Document key spacing/density rules.
5. Add tests only for stable class markers, not pixel-perfect visuals.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Layout feels less crowded and more deliberate.
- Design guideline records spacing principles.
- Tests pass.

## Verification Commands

```bash
pytest -q tests/test_live_ui_snapshot.py
```

## Non-goals

- Do not implement TensorBoard/W&B import.
- Do not implement Prometheus/Grafana integration.
- Do not implement cloud sync.
- Do not implement multi-user auth.
- Do not add a database backend.
- Do not add React/Vue/Svelte build tooling unless separately approved.
- Do not add heavy dependencies to core.
- Do not perform TestPyPI/PyPI release work in this slice.

## Handoff Notes

- This milestone is about visible product completeness, not broad backend expansion.
- Prefer better demo data, empty states, affordances, and layout polish over complex systems.
- Keep the default UI minimal, but make hidden capabilities discoverable.
- Avoid fake functionality. Showcase hints must reflect actual local state or clearly available actions.
