# 02_capability_hints_ui — capability hints UI

## Objective

Render compact capability hints without making the default screen crowded.

## Context

v1.1.1 implemented true compare/overlay and core UI interaction hardening. However, the actual UI can still look less capable than the design mockups because many advanced features are hidden behind drawers, sparse demo data, and minimal affordances. v1.1.2 should improve perceived product completeness without violating local-first or lightweight-package principles.

## Dependencies

- v1.1.1 UI Polish / True Compare completed.
- Live Board core APIs remain compatible.
- Existing static dashboard/report/compare/agent/template-forge behavior remains green.

## Target Files

- src/skilllogboard/live/templates/live.html
- tests/test_live_ui_snapshot.py

## Implementation Steps

1. Add a compact hint row near the overview or workspace caption.
2. Show hints such as runs detected, shared metrics, compare ready, artifacts, warnings, agent evidence.
3. Only show hints backed by state data.
4. Use subdued visual style; avoid large cards.
5. Add tests for hint region and labels.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Capability hint row exists.
- Hints are compact and data-backed.
- Default layout remains minimal.
- Tests pass.

## Verification Commands

```bash
pytest -q tests/test_live_ui_snapshot.py
```

## Non-goals

- Do not implement TensorBoard/W&B import.
- Do not implement Prometheus/Grafana integration.
- Do not implement cloud sync.
- Do not implement multi-user auth.
- Do not add a database backend.
- Do not add React/Vue/Svelte build tooling unless separately approved.
- Do not add heavy dependencies to core.
- Do not perform TestPyPI/PyPI release work in this slice.

## Handoff Notes

- This milestone is about visible product completeness, not broad backend expansion.
- Prefer better demo data, empty states, affordances, and layout polish over complex systems.
- Keep the default UI minimal, but make hidden capabilities discoverable.
- Avoid fake functionality. Showcase hints must reflect actual local state or clearly available actions.
